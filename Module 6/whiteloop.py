# Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5 using a while loop

# Initialize a variable

# Set the condition for the while loop
while count <=5:
# Add a condition to skip printing when count is 3
    count +=1
# This code will execute as long as the condition (count<=5) is true
   if count == 3:
    # this code will execute as long as the condition (count <=5) is true
    print(count)
    count +=1
